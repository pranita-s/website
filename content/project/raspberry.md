* **Introduction**
	* This was my BE project. I was part of team of four.
	* There has been an upsurge observed in the number of small scale and/or home-based businesses. This has been fueled by the internet which makes it very easy to set up one and offer services from the comfort of oneâ€™s home, accompanied by the reduction in costs of hardware devices in recent times. However, there are a myriad of networking needs of such offices in order to function smoothly, and most of them are expensive. Some of the most commonly needed ones are an always online file server, an intra-organization email server, a web server and a virtual private network service to stay secure online. We look at a way to cater to these networking needs by providing a solution which is cost effective and involves very low maintenance. 

* **Our Solution**
	* To propose a fulfillment of the above requirements, we used Raspberry Pi. It is a mini computer which can be configured as Web Server, File Server, Email server and VPN at the same time. Being a cheaper alternative and having diverse capabailities, it posed as a great solution.
	* We carried out its performace testing in the Central Computer Lab of our college with more than 150 students using the hosted servers at the same time.
